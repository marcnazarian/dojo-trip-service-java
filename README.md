dojo-trip-service-java
======================

This is a clone of the kata created by Sandro Mancuso.


Original kata and source code can be found on Sandro's github: https://github.com/sandromancuso/trip-service-kata


Video of the kata can we watched:
- here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NnElPO5BU0
- or here (live session): https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/5251-testing-and-refactoring-legacy-code


This is my own implementation of the exercice in Java.


The objective is to test and refactor the legacy TripService class.


The end result should be well-crafted code that express the domain.


There is only one simple rule:
- Do not refactor production code if it's not covered by tests (unless you need it to write a test, in this case, only reafactoring provided by the IDE it tolerated)
